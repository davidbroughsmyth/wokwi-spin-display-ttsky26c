## How it works

Logic to spin 7 segment display.

Clock is expected to be 2hz.

Uses D flip-flops with reset to sequence like a shift register the segments of the dislay, only for the outer 6 segements A, B, C, D, E, F

The D flip-flips feed the !Q inverted output to the start of the FF, but this is fliped to the Q out of the first FF via a multiplexer.  
The muliplexer is controled by input IN0, setting to "1" has the affect to stop the sequence after the FF's progress 6 shifts.  

Reset clears all the display.

Input IN0 stops the sequence after 

## How to test

Set clock and watch the display. Push resest. Flip input IO0 high or low.
